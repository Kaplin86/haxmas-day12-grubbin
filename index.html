          Jk. im not a very political person. i bet i got you there. haha. what i will actually be discussing is why inside of hit pokemon fan web game "Pokemon Autochess" grubbin is the best unit.

          1.
          Grubbin is apart of the hatch group, which means it will automatically evolve after every 5 stages. This saves money which you can instead be using to reroll constantly (also known as hyper-rolling).

          2.
          Grubbin (and evolutions)'s ability "Zap Cannon" allows it to deal special damage, then inflict paralysis and armor break for a maximum of 4 seconds. Armor break can easily dissolve stronger units in more defensive synergies such as ground and rock.

          3.
          In a dream i stated grubbin was the best ground electric pokemon. While this isnt necessarily true, my point still stands.

          4.
          Grubbin is one of the few 3-ranged electric synergy units. This means that it can easily sweep enemies from a distance using speed-based builds. Electric synergy causes every third or fourth attack to also include an extra attack, which further improves this strategy.
